## Branding Guidelines

### Logo

* Do not modify the logo by changing the colors, changing of the aspect ration,
   or other alterations to the corporate identity.

* When using the logo to refer to Slint from a location not dedicated to Slint,
   use the full versions of the logo with the full tagline ("GUI toolkit").

  For screen, the files (in png and svg) are located here:
  * [Light](./for_Screen/Slint_logo_GUI_toolkit/blue_black/)
  * [Dark](./for_Screen/Slint_logo_GUI_toolkit/blue_white/)

  For print, the equivalent versions in pdf are:

  * [Light background](./for_Print/slint_logo_GUI_toolkit_blue_black.pdf)
  * [Dark background](./for_Print/slint_logo_GUI_toolkit_blue_white.pdf)

* When using the logo to refer to Slint for illustrative purposes, from a place
   where the viewer is expected to already know about Slint (e.g. because it is
   on the Slint website itself) use the simple versions of the logo.

  For print, the equivalent versions in pdf are:

  * [Light background](./for_Print/slint_logo_blue_black.pdf)
  * [Dark background](./for_Print/slint_logo_blue_white.pdf)

* For the cases where a square or circular logo is required (e.g. social media
   avatar), the square versions of the logo can be used. Prefer the version with
   the text.

  * [Light background](./for_Print/slint_logo_vertical_blue_black.pdf)
  * [Dark background](./for_Print/slint_logo_vertical_blue_white.pdf)

* For a small icon where the text would not be visible otherwise, use the square
   versions of the logo without the text.

### Name

The name of the product is ***Slint***, not ~~*Slint UI*~~.

`slint-ui` or `slint_ui` is used as username for online service when (and only when) `slint` is already taken.

The company (legal entity) behind Slint is *SixtyFPS GmbH*. That name should only be used to refer to the company,
including the *GmbH*. (*SixtyFPS* was the former name of the product but should no longer be used.)
Employees of SixtyFPS GmbH should still use the name *Slint* whenever possible (e.g. on conference badges)
